# hikari

Hikari is an open-source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme perfect for bloggers and developers who want the best of both worlds: sharing snippets and stories/pictures of their latest vacation in Tokyo (that's just for the example, you may want to go to Kyoto too). 

But Hikari is also:

- Simple & elegant
- Fluid, responsive
- Lightweight (no JS library has been abused during the development of this theme)
- & packed with syntax highlighting for you coders
